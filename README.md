Title: L1 - Student Score Manager: Handling Dynamic Adjustments

Problem Statement: You are creating a score management system for student results. Start with an array of 10 student scores. The program should do the following:

For any student with a score below 40, increase their score by 20. For students with scores over 90, adjust their score to a maximum of 90. Count and log how many students passed (score of 50 or more) after the adjustments. Log the final adjusted array of scores.
